### 🟡 Intermediate (Tricky + Coding Based)

11. Write a program using `#define` to define a constant value and print it.
12. Write a macro to calculate the **square of a number**.
13. Predict the output:

```c
#define PI 3.14
printf("%f", PI);
```

14. Write a program demonstrating **conditional compilation** using `#ifdef`.
15. Explain the difference between `#define` and `const`.
16. Can a macro take multiple arguments? Give example.
17. Predict the output:

```c
#define ADD(a,b) a+b
int x = ADD(2,3)*2;
printf("%d", x);
```

18. How do **inline functions** compare with macros?
19. Write a program using `#ifndef` to avoid multiple inclusion of a header file.
20. Explain potential pitfalls of macros (like multiple evaluation).
